    - Hello, good job back there on saving Dr Aaron, the people are grateful for
      you.
    - 'Anyways, welcome to the Town. It''s a lovely place to be in compared to that
      cave right? ... or maybe you like it there ???  '
    - You are currently located at the heart of the town. Behind me is the Townhall.
      You will report to me here to receive your next quest!
    - To the west side of the Town, we have the weapons shop run by Martin. Hit him
      up for some equipment that will boost your stats and aid you in battle.
    - To the east side of the Town, we have the Inn run by Jeanne. Go to her and
      she will make sure you feel well rested before leaving the inn!
    - Lastly, on the largest floating platform, at the highest point of the town,
      we have the Well-Ordered Lab.
    - Ofcourse the lab is run by none other than Dr Aaron. He also runs a side hustle,
      selling consumables and weird concoctions...
    - 'I drank one the other day and I felt so much better! Maybe you should pay
      him a visit haha. '
    - Oh just a warning, the journey to his lab may not be as simple as it seems.
      It will put your physical limits to the test.

      should check out the area to see what is going on.
    - Don't worry, we won't have to walk to the forest now that we have retrieved
      the ancient artifact.
    - The artifact powers portals throughout the town and in deserted areas, allowing
      for long distance travelling in a short span of time!
    - I can assure you the portals are 99.99% safe. I mean, we can never be absolutely
      sure about everything right?
    - On the right, we have the portal to the forest. Walk near the portal and press
      T to teleport to the other side.
