    - Hello, good job back there on saving Dr Aaron, the people are grateful for
      you.
    - 'Anyways, welcome to the Town. It''s a lovely place to be in compared to that
      cave right? ... or maybe you like it there ???  '
    - You are currently located at the heart of the town. Behind me is the Townhall.
      You will report to me here to receive your next quest!
    - To the west side of the Town, we have the weapons shop run by Martin. Hit him
      up for some equipment that will boost your stats and aid you in battle.
    - To the east side of the Town, we have the Inn run by Jeanne. Go to her and
      she will make sure you feel well rested before leaving the inn!
    - Lastly, on the largest floating platform, at the highest point of the town,
      we have the Well-Ordered Lab.
    - Ofcourse the lab is run by none other than Dr Aaron. He also runs a side hustle,
      selling consumables and weird concoctions...
    - 'I drank one the other day and I felt so much better! Maybe you should pay
      him a visit haha. '
    - Oh just a warning, the journey to his lab may not be as simple as it seems.
      It will put your physical limits to the test.

    - The forest keeper, Lloyd, has reported that the forest animals are behaving
      abnormally.
    - There has also been a rise in reports of aggression on these villagers. We
      should check out the area to see what is going on.
    - Don't worry, we won't have to walk to the forest now that we have retrieved
      the ancient artifact.
    - The artifact powers portals throughout the town and in deserted areas, allowing
      for long distance travelling in a short span of time!
    - I can assure you the portals are 99.99% safe. I mean, we can never be absolutely
      sure about everything right?
    - On the right, we have the portal to the forest. Walk near the portal and press
      T to teleport to the other side.

    - Ah, so you know the details already. Seems like the military has stolen the
      artifact. From the coordinates given by Dr Aaron, its a base station headed
      by Supreme Leader
    - HQ just informed me that he has gone rogue and joined with the Resistance.
      It seems like you would have to enter the base and fight fellow Xenonians.
    - 'What is Resistance? They are a group of Xenonians that think they are better
      than the government. '
    - They have carried out multiple attacks on Xenonians and are looking to takeover
      the government, ruling under their own ideology.
    - Recently, an attack was launched against us in sector CS2103. I did not expect
      the Supreme Leader to also be a part of them.
