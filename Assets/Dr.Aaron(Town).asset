      you can see it's not very accessible...
    - Thank you for saving me back there, who knows what might have happened to me
      if not for you.
    - Anyways, I run this lab in the village. While doing my own research, I sell
      my consumables and potions.
    - Concocted and fine tuned, these can greatly help you in combat.

    dialogue:
    - On closer inspection, this seems like an artifact that has the effect to affect
      one's emotions. I think this might have triggered the animals in the forest...
      which resulted in increased aggression.
    - I'd very much like to do more research on that artifact... but the army is
      chasing me for portal technology. I'm afraid I cannot help you just yet.
    - I will take the artifact from you. It will be safer in my hands!

    - 'I had spent some of my extra time investigating the Red Artifact, carrying
      out some simple experiments. '
    - Turns out, it is actually an artifact that somehow got activated by the forest
      animals. It amplifies the anger and rage within living creatures with its radiance
      and grants the holder increased power.
    - No wonder the military was so interested... I was able to amplify the portal's
      power using this artifact. It's range should be able to cover even outer space!
    - But luckily I always have this policy of placing a tracker on my artifacts.
      Yes, I am able to track the location of the Red Artifact...

    - It seems to me it is currently at the coordinates of a military installation...
    - It cannot be. The fact that it is transmitting means that the tracker is working
      perfectly fine. Only the presence of jammers will deviate its accuracy by a
      little...
    - I am not suggesting anything, but the fact is it is in their facility at this
      very moment...
    characterDialogue:
    - Perhaps your tracker is malfunctioning?
    - Did the military steal your technology?
