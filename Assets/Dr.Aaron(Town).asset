    - Oh hello, good to see you! It's rare that we get any visitors up here... as
      you can see it's not very accessible...
    - Thank you for saving me back there, who knows what might have happened to me
      if not for you.
    - Anyways, I run this lab in the village. While doing my own research, I sell
      my consumables and potions.
    - Concocted and fine tuned, these can greatly help you in combat.

    - On closer inspection, this seems like an artifact that has the effect of affecting

      which resulted in increased aggression.
    - I'd very much like to do more research on that artifact... but the army is
      chasing me for portal technology. I'm afraid I cannot help you just yet.
    - I will take the artifact from you. It will be safer in my hands!

      animals. It amplifies the anger and rage within living creatures with its radiance
      and grants the holder increased power.
    - No wonder the military was so interested... I was able to amplify the portal's
      power using this artifact. It's range should be able to cover even outer space!
    - But luckily I always have this policy of placing a tracker on my artifacts.
      Yes, I am able to track the location of the Red Artifact...

      little...

      very moment...

    - Perhaps your tracker is malfunctioning?
