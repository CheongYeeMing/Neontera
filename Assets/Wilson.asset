    dialogue:
    - Hi, I'm Wilson. Man of few words. Oh sorry, I meant DADDY of few words. I eat
      STRAWBRIESSS for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
    - I love toasting ham and cheese bread for breakfast, you may use my toaster
      if you wish... then my happiness spread to you :D .. but please do not change
      the settings...
    - You may think I'm busy practicing drums only, but I am secretly training my
      guitar skills so I can defeat this girl.
    - 'Who is it, you might ask. Well, this girl has a weird squishies fetish, I
      heard she has a room filled with cute soft squishies. '
    - Okay, that is a lot for a man of few words. Be careful, I may be a man of few
      words but I can mislead you >:)
    - Take this, it might help you for the final battle! Or whenever you feel like
      drinking my juice >:)
